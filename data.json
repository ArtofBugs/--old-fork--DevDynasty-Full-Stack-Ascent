    {
      "question": "How have you dealt with a team member not pulling their weight in the past?",
      "correct": "If I observe a teammate falling behind, my first step would be to organize a team check-in meeting. This allows for an open discussion for everyone to talk about potential concerns about the workload, challenges, etc.",
      "incorrect": [
        "If a teammate is slacking off, I would probably ignore it until the last minute or I might mention it to the project manager, but I wouldn’t want to get too involved.",
        "I’d probably pick up their slack and do their part myself. It’s easier than dealing with confrontation, and I don’t want the project to suffer because of someone else’s laziness.",
        "I probably wouldn't do anything. It's the manager's responsibility to make sure everyone is doing what they are supposed to be doing."

    {
      "question": "Describe a time when you faced a tight deadline or a high-pressure situation. How did you handle the stress, and what was the outcome?",
      "correct": "There was an additional feature that my team was supposed to implement for a big assignment, but we missed it until a few days before the deadline. We communicated effectively about what we would need to change, re-evaluated the flow of our program, and allocated ourselves in such a way that we were able to complete the assignment in its entirety.",
      "incorrect": [
        "There was an additional feature that my team was supposed to implement for a big assignment, but we missed it until a few days before the deadline. We ended up not adding it because we only had a few days and we'd spent so much time on it already.",
        "There was an additional feature that my team was supposed to implement for a big assignment, but we missed it until a few days before the deadline. I wasn't the team leader so I didn't bring it up, because it wasn't really my responsibility. In the project review I explained to the professor that it wasn't my fault.",
        "There was an additional feature that my team was supposed to implement for a big assignment, but we missed it until a few days before the deadline. We complained to the professor that they were asking for too much in the assignment. We had other classes that we needed to focus on."

      "question": "Describe a situation where you had to quickly learn a new technology or programming language. How did you go about it, and what was the outcome?",
      "correct": "A class I was taking in the Winter required students to know Python. Over the break I spent time self-learning through online resources, Python documentation, and mock projects on Youtube.",
      "incorrect": [
        "A class I was taking in the Winter required students to know Python. I ended up dropping the class. There was no way I could learn a new language in such a short amount of time.",
        "A class I was taking in the Winter required students to know Python. I looked up a few videos on Youtube and ended up using ChatGPT throughout the majority of the class. I didn't learn it super thoroughly, but enough to know how to ask ChatGPT to do my homework.",
        "A class I was taking in the Winter required students to know Python. I didn't have time over break to learn it myself so during the class I relied on my classmates and the TAs to walk me through everything."
