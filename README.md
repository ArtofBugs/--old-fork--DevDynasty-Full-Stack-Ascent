# DevDynasty: Fullstack Ascent ðŸ’»ðŸ“ˆ

Play as a computer science major undergoing the application process for a full-stack developer internship! You'll experience resume building, choosing a company to apply to, and interviews. Will you get the offer?!

# CS 290 Final Project

We created this project with an ambitious idea to simulate what we, as CS majors, know all too well: the internship application and interview process. The result is a web game born out of our shared experiences that provides an engaging and low-stakes way for our fellow students to relive the challenging experience.
